## Portal Integration Points

All pages now redirect to portal routes that need to be created:

### Required Portal Routes
1. `/portal/licenses` - Fishing license application form
2. `/portal/vessels/register` - Vessel registration form
3. `/portal/licenses/renew` - License renewal form
4. `/portal/reports/submit` - Catch report submission form
5. `/portal/reports` - View past catch reports
6. `/portal/dashboard` - Unified view of all applications

---

## Benefits of New Architecture

### 1. **Clear Separation of Concerns**
- ❌ Old: Forms scattered across public pages
- ✅ New: Public pages educate, portal handles transactions

### 2. **Single Source of Truth**
- ❌ Old: Users submit from various locations
- ✅ New: All applications managed in one dashboard

### 3. **Better User Experience**
- ❌ Old: Confusing navigation, duplicate functionality
- ✅ New: Clear path: Learn → Apply in Portal → Track

### 4. **Enhanced Security**
- ❌ Old: Public form submissions
- ✅ New: All transactions require authentication

### 5. **Easier Maintenance**
- ❌ Old: Update forms in 4+ places
- ✅ New: Update once in portal, info pages stable

### 6. **Consistent Design**
- ❌ Old: Varying implementations per page
- ✅ New: Unified design system, predictable layout
