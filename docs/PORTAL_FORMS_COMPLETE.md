## Technical Implementation

### Common Patterns Across All Forms:

1. **State Management:**
   ```typescript
   const [formData, setFormData] = useState({ ... });
   const [files, setFiles] = useState({ ... });
   ```

2. **Form Handlers:**
   - `handleInputChange` - Text inputs
   - `handleSelectChange` - Dropdowns
   - `handleFileChange` - File uploads
   - `handleCheckboxChange` - Checkboxes

3. **Submission Flow:**
   ```typescript
   handleSubmit() {
     // Log data (TODO: API integration)
     // Show toast notification
     // Redirect to dashboard
   }
   ```

4. **Navigation:**
   - Back button to respective portal section
   - Next/Previous for multi-step forms
   - Cancel option where appropriate

### Component Usage:
- ✅ Shadcn UI components (Card, Button, Input, Label, Select, Checkbox, Textarea)
- ✅ Framer Motion animations
- ✅ Lucide React icons
- ✅ Next.js useRouter for navigation
- ✅ Toast notifications for feedback

### Validation:
- HTML5 required attributes
- Type validation (email, tel, number, datetime-local)
- Step-by-step validation in wizard forms
- Terms and conditions checkboxes

---

## Routes Updated

Updated service pages to point to correct portal routes:

### Fishing Licenses Page:
- `/portal/licenses` → `/portal/licenses/apply`
- Updated 2 CTA buttons

### Service Page Mappings:
```
/services/fishing-licenses → /portal/licenses/apply
/services/vessel-registration → /portal/vessels/register
/services/license-renewal → /portal/licenses/renew
/services/catch-reporting → /portal/reports/submit
```

---

## Data Flow Architecture

### Current State (Mock Data):
```
User fills form → Console log → Toast notification → Redirect to dashboard
```

### Future State (With Backend):
```
User fills form → POST to API → Receive tracking number → Update database
                ↓
        Email confirmation sent
                ↓
        Redirect to dashboard with new application shown
```

const { data: session, status } = useSession({
  required: true,
  onUnauthenticated() {
    router.push("/login");
  },
});

// Prepopulate user data from session:
useEffect(() => {
  if (session?.user) {
    setFormData(prev => ({
      ...prev,
      email: session.user.email,
      firstName: session.user.name?.split(" ")[0],
      ...
    }));
  }
}, [session]);
```
