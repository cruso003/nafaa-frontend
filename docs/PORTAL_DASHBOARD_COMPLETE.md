## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management:
```typescript
const [searchQuery, setSearchQuery] = useState("");
const [statusFilter, setStatusFilter] = useState("all");
const [typeFilter, setTypeFilter] = useState("all");
```

### Filtering Logic:
```typescript
const filteredApplications = allApplications.filter((app) => {
  const matchesSearch = 
    app.id.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    app.description.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase()) ||
    app.type.toLowerCase().includes(searchQuery.toLowerCase());

  const matchesStatus = statusFilter === "all" || app.status === statusFilter;
  const matchesType = typeFilter === "all" || app.category === typeFilter;

  return matchesSearch && matchesStatus && matchesType;
});
```

### Stats Calculation:
```typescript
const applicationStats = {
  total: allApplications.length,
  pending: allApplications.filter((app) => app.status === "pending").length,
  approved: allApplications.filter((app) => app.status === "approved").length,
  underReview: allApplications.filter((app) => app.status === "under-review").length,
  rejected: allApplications.filter((app) => app.status === "rejected").length,
};
```

### Components Used:
- ✅ Shadcn UI `Input` for search
- ✅ Shadcn UI `Select` for filters
- ✅ Shadcn UI `Button` for actions
- ✅ Shadcn UI `Badge` for status indicators
- ✅ Framer Motion for animations
- ✅ Lucide React icons throughout

### Step 3: Track (Portal Dashboard - NEW!)
User monitors ALL applications in one unified view:
- `/portal/dashboard` → See all submissions with status
